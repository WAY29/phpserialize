Fork of https://github.com/aioTV/phpserialize based on https://github.com/mitsuhiko/phpserialize

A port of the serialize and unserialize functions of php to python. This module
implements the python serialization interface (eg: provides dumps, loads and
similar functions).

Sessions unserializing is also supported if they were saved using PHP's
internal serializer and without encryption (see
http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/configuration.html#suhosin.session.encrypt).
